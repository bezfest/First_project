# My_first_project

Hi! I am very new to programming and my first language that I am trying to learn is Python3.
For my little first project as I learn I wanted to create a "app" that can take reservations for certains table in a "fake" Japanese restaurant.
How I managed to do that is a bit special. There is a lot of pictures out of which I made buttons and stuff with help of photoshop.
Currently I am stuck with certain functions and variables.
I would also like to find a Methor if anyone ever reads this.
